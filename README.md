# What was this supposed to be for

- Large massive functionality considering it's in a terminal
- To worship God

# So, how can I make it?
Simple as that, mate. Use ```make``` to build the project and then run the executable.

# Well, how can I download new translations for the Bible?
It's easy as well. Download any text file with the plain text of the Bible (NO JSON/XML/ET CETERA FORMATS). Then move this file into Bible-CLI/Translations/ and then change Bible-CLI/bible.conf by replacing the value of the translation with your file's name (the file also must be in .txt)

# License?
There is no license, and all that rubbish, just because the Bible doesn't need it. You can modify the code however you can and however you want.
