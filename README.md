**!!! FIRST BIBLE NIV VERSION IN PLAIN TEXT RIGHT IN THIS REPO !!!**
# What was this supposed to be for
- In memory of King Terry
- Large massive functionality considering it's in a terminal
- To worship God

# So, how can I make it?
Simple as that, mate. Use ```make``` to build the project and then run the executable.

# Well, how can I download new translations for the Bible?
It's easy as well.
- Download any text file with the plain text of the Bible (NO JSON/XML/ET CETERA FORMATS).
- Rename it considering the file format ```<LANGUAGE>_<TRANSLATION>.bbl```.
- Move this file into ```Bible-CLI/Translations/```
- Change ```Bible-CLI/bible.conf``` by replacing the value of the translation and the language **OR** do the same using ```Bible-CLI/ch``` (which is a bash script): ```./ch <language> <translation>``` (the file also **must** be in the *.bbl* format)

# License?
There is no license, and all that rubbish, just because the Bible doesn't need it. You can modify the code however you can and however you want.
